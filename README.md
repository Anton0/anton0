**Hi there 👋 🇦🇺**

I'm Anthony Engelstad and, my passsion is fixing broken things, even if it means I have to break them myself first 🛠️

I'm currently the Site Reliability Lead at Pepperstone Pty Ltd, and I've previously lead the SRE team at [Stax](www.stax.io), both focusing on building observable and reliable services in Amazon Web Services ☁️, together with application teams and developers.
